  # Example deployment job - demonstrates how to deploy using GitHub environments
  # This job is commented out and serves as a template for users
  # To use:
  # 1. Create a GitHub environment (Settings > Environments)
  # 2. Configure environment variables in that environment
  # 3. Set up AWS OIDC provider and IAM role with trust relationship to GitHub
  # 4. Uncomment this job and customize as needed
